Machine Learning Pipeline for Sentiment Analysis
This pipeline is designed to perform sentiment analysis on text data, classifying
reviews as either positive or negative. It leverages Hugging Face's transformers and datasets libraries, 
building upon a pre-trained BERT model for efficiency and performance. 

The pipeline initiates by loading the IMDb dataset, a widely used benchmark for sentiment analysis, using the 

datasets library. This provides a robust collection of movie reviews pre-split into training and testing sets. 

Next, the raw text data undergoes preprocessing using the bert-base-uncased tokenizer from the transformers library. 
This crucial step converts text into numerical tokens and prepares it for BERT's input format, including padding and
truncation to handle varying review lengths.

A pre-trained bert-base-uncased model is then loaded and fine-tuned for binary sentiment classification. 
Fine-tuning on a pre-trained model is a core design choice as it significantly reduces training time and computational 
resources compared to training from scratch, while leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge acquired during BERT's initial pre-training. 
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics: accuracy and F1-score, providing a comprehensive view of its 
classification capabilities. Finally, the fine-tuned model is saved, enabling its quick loading for future inference tasks on new, unseen text inputs.



Anticipated challenges include significant computational requirements due to BERT's size; this can be addressed 
by utilizing GPU accelerators (e.g., Google Colab) and optimizing batch sizes. Data preprocessing requires careful handling of tokenization and 
sequence lengths to prevent errors or loss of information, managed effectively by the transformers tokenizer's built-in functionalities
like truncation and padding.
